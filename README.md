# Hi — I’m Amit 👋  
**Principal Engineer / Tech Lead • Platform Builder • Systems Architect • Sci-Fi Enthusiast**

I build **production-grade platforms that handle complex business workflows, burst traffic, and revenue-critical paths.**  
Currently leading architecture and delivery of a **no-code / low-code product powering US enterprise customers**, focused on correctness, extensibility, and developer ergonomics.

I care deeply about **reliability, clean system boundaries, and long-term maintainability** — not just shipping code, but shipping systems that scale safely.
