# Hi — I’m Amit 👋

Tech Lead • Techy • Gamer • Sci‑fi sucker

Welcome to my GitHub corner. I lead a pivotal part of a US‑based product — a no‑code / low‑code solution that helps tame highly complex customer requirements. I think technically, stay open‑minded, and always prefer well‑done solutions over "done fast."

## ⭐ Featured Projects (brief)
These projects are currently private and actively developed — links will only work for accounts with access.

- readergo — My brainchild: an all‑in‑one, keyboard‑first knowledge platform for writers and knowledge workers. Highly extensible, community‑driven, and designed to help people think in diverse ways, manage personalized data, and interact with content intuitively. Built with Next.js 15, TipTap, and PostgreSQL. This is my primary focus right now.

- zframework — A fast, opinionated TypeScript framework I’m building to bootstrap professional apps quickly. Works well with IDEs like Cursor and is actively under development to provide shared utilities, conventions, and developer ergonomics across projects.

- my-services — A lightweight "AWS-on-my-laptop" idea: a set of shell tooling and simple service templates to run, start, stop, and manage dockerized apps from the terminal. I use this to host personal services — fun fact: readergo is currently hosted on my old gaming laptop using my‑services.
